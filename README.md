This is still a work-in-progress.

This library is a ruby implementation of the ```encrypt``` and ```decrypt``` functions required to communicate with CCAvenue Payment Gateway (the new version).

```crypto.rb``` is the file you are interested in. We have documented it as much as we can.

### To Do

1) Add a sample controller (for use in rails application)
2) Add sample Views
3) Add generators to make it easy for prople to use this library without having to look at the code
4) Package this whole thing as a rubygem
